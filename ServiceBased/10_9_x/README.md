Sample tools that help administer workflow items.

## Features
These sample tools are script tools that utilize the Python API to perform various tasks against the ArcGIS Workflow Manager workflow items. 

   - The AdminTools.zip contains script tools that allow workflow admins to import, export, and transfer workflows.
   - The RecPost_Tool.zip contains a script tool that may be published as a geoprocessing service to reconcile and post branch versions.

2. Download the admin toolbox and accompanying script files.
3. Before running the admin tools, update the Config.py file with admin connection information for the workflow item and make sure it stays in the same location as the tool script files.
