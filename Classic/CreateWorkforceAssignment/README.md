WorkflowManager-Workforce
=========================

This sample allows for the creation of Workforce for ArcGIS assignments from
ArcGIS Workflow Manager.

Generally, this sample should be configured to be run as a geoprocessing step
in a Workflow Manager workflow using either the LaunchGPTool or ExecuteGPTool
custom step types.

The Assignment Location is based on the Location of Interest (LOI) of the job.
If the job contains an Area of Interest, the Assignment Location is based
on the centroid of the area. Multipart Locations of Interest result in an
Assignment created for each part. If no LOI is defined for the job, an error is
displayed as the location is a required component of an Assignment.

Deployment
----------

1. Download the python toolbox and save it locally
2. If using ArcGIS Desktop or versions of ArcGIS Pro 1.2 or older, install the
Requests python library. Requests is already included with ArcGIS Pro starting with 1.3
3. Configure the Workflow Manager step arguments

    ![Step Configuration](doc/step.png)

    1. Select the toolbox and tool from where you saved it in step 1
    2. **layerURL** - Configure to point to the Assignments feature service used by Workforce
        - Search for the Workforce project within your Organization and open it

        ![Item](doc/item.png)

        - Select the Assignments sub-item

        ![Project Contents](doc/contents.png)

        - Right-click the Service URL link and copy the link location

        ![Assignments Details](doc/assignments.png)

		- Add **/applyEdits** at the end of the Service URL link

    3. **jobID** - This should generally be the [Job:ID] token.
    It is used to populate the Work Order field in the created Assignment.
    4. **dispatcherId** - This is the ID of the dispatcher that the Assignments
    is created as. This is found from the Dispatchers sub-item of the
    Workforce project item. You must manually display OBJECT ID field
    ![Dispatcher](doc/dispatcher.png)
    5. **assignmentId** - This is the ID of the Assignment Type from Workforce. To find this,
    open the Service URL link from step ii above, and click the JSON link in the top left.
    This displays the detailed information about the service. From this, find the ASSIGN_TYPE
    coded value domain values and use the code value associated with the desired
    Assignment Type.

            "domain" :
            {
              "type" : "codedValue",
              "name" : "ASSIGN_TYPE",
              "codedValues" : [
                {
                  "name" : "Collect Data",
                  "code" : 1
                }
              ]
            }

    6. **description** - This is used to populate the description of the newly
    created Assignment.
    7. **jtcPath** - This can be used to override the Workflow Manager connection to use.
    Advanced usage only
    8. **objectIds** - This is an output parameter populated with the Object IDs
    of the newly created assignments. Advanced usage only

Note: To run the geoprocessing tool, you must sign in to your organizational portal to be able to access feature services in the Workforce project.
